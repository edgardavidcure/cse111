Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
When I was working on the last project I realized how important using functions is, because I could use the functions endless times without having to type new code. I just needed to use the parameters and reuse the functions as I wanted. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
It allows you to make sure the functions work properly and that the results you expect are actually coming up



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
I learned to use the debugger for python a lot. I would use it for those times where my code was giving me a different result than I expected and needed to check where exactly the problem was happening. It was very helpful.
I would first read the code, understand the variables, functions, parameters, the description of the functions and the intended results, I would run the program, check if there are any issues, test multiple results and if the program crashes, I will try to identify where the problem is, try to fix it myself, use the debugger, use the test functions and try to run it again
